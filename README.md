Welcome to the Home of ESAPI 3.x 

News
==========
First off, if you are looking for a version of ESAPI to use with your JVM-based project, this is not the one you are looking for. Instead, you want the latest ESAPI 2.x version from [esapi-java-legacy](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy). This ESAPI repo is for the development of ESAPI 3 which
is still in the _very early_ planning stages. The code that is currently in this GitHub repo (as of 2020-07-17) is likely to be completely rewritten, possibly several times, therefore please do not bother to submit PRs or GitHub issues relating to outdated or vulnerable dependencies. ESAPI 3 has not been released, even as a Release Candidate and we will make sure all the dependencies are updated when we do get around to making RC versions available.
